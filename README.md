# average_face_yunako
making average faces which are image files or gif  

I programming by being referenced below two git hubs.
  - making average face : https://github.com/stekhn/average-faces-opencv
     * This code made by python2. So I change the code. 
  - making a gif : https://github.com/johnwmillr/Facer/blob/master/facer/facer.py
     * I referenced this code because I wanna make a gif file.

Before using my code, you have to install libraries like cmake, numpy, opencv-python, requests, scikit-image, unidecode, dlib, etc..
